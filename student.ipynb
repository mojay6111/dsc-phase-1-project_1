    "# OVERVIEW\n",
    "\n",
    "As we expand into the aviation industry, I recognize the importance of thoroughly understanding the risks associated with purchasing and operating aircraft for both commercial and private enterprises. To ensure our success and minimize potential hazards, I will use the CRISP-DM methodology to systematically analyze aviation risks. My focus will be on identifying the aircraft with the lowest risk, predicting which models are more likely to be involved in accidents, and examining the environmental and operational factors that contribute to these risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, I will gather and analyze data on aircraft specifications, safety records, incident reports, and more. By applying advanced modeling techniques, Iâ€™ll be able to provide actionable insights that will guide our decisions on which aircraft to purchase and how to operate them safely. Ultimately, my goal is to deliver clear, data-driven recommendations that will help us confidently enter the aviation industry while ensuring the highest level of safety and operational efficiency.\n",

    "## Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Your company is expanding in to new industries to diversify its portfolio. Specifically, they are interested in purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private enterprises, but do not know anything about the potential risks of aircraft. You are charged with determining which aircraft are the lowest risk for the company to start this new business endeavor. You must then translate your findings into actionable insights that the head of the new aviation division can use to help decide which aircraft to purchase.\n"
